	<p>Ancient Greece (approx. 500 BCE): Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea develops paradoxes that involve infinite series, which would later be studied by mathematicians attempting to understand the nature of infinity. Zeno's paradoxes involve concepts such as the dichotomy paradox (in which a runner can never reach the finish line because he must first travel half the distance, then half the remaining distance, and so on), and the arrow paradox (in which an arrow in flight appears to be motionless at any given moment). These paradoxes raise questions about the nature of continuity and infinity that would later be addressed by calculus.

17th century: English mathematician John Wallis develops the method of indivisibles, a precursor to calculus that involves breaking a shape into an infinite number of infinitesimal parts. Wallis's method involves dividing a shape into "indivisible" or "infinitely small" parts, and then summing these parts to find the area or volume of the shape. This approach is similar to the modern concept of integration, but lacked the rigor and notation of later developments in calculus.

17th century: German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz independently develops calculus using a system of notation that would later become the standard for the field. Leibniz's notation includes the use of dx and dy to represent infinitesimal changes in x and y, respectively, and the integral symbol (the long S) to represent integration. Leibniz also developed the concept of the derivative, which measures the rate of change of a function.

17th century: English mathematician Isaac Newton independently develops calculus using a system of notation that differs from Leibniz's, but is still used today. Newton's notation involves the use of dots (or primes) to represent derivatives, and the symbol âˆ« to represent integration. Newton also developed the concept of the derivative and the integral, and used calculus to develop his laws of motion and universal gravitation.

18th century: Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler contributes to the development of calculus by introducing many of the concepts and notations still used today, including the notation for the derivative. Euler's contributions to calculus include the development of the calculus of variations (which involves finding the function that optimizes a certain quantity), and the introduction of the notation f'(x) to represent the derivative of a function f.

19th century: French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy develops a rigorous definition of the limit, a concept crucial to calculus. Cauchy's definition of the limit provides a precise way of defining the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain value, and is necessary for many of the fundamental concepts of calculus, such as continuity and differentiability.

19th century: German mathematician Bernhard Riemann develops the Riemann integral, a new approach to integration that is more flexible than previous methods. The Riemann integral allows for the integration of functions that are not continuous or have discontinuities, and paved the way for further developments in integration theory.

20th century: The development of set theory and modern logic lead to a more rigorous foundation for calculus, with mathematicians such as Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor contributing to this effort. Set theory provides a formal framework for the concepts of infinity and continuity that are central to calculus, and allows for the development of more rigorous definitions and proofs in the field.

20th century: The development of computers and numerical methods leads to new applications of calculus, such as computational fluid dynamics and optimization algorithms. Calculus is used in a wide variety of fields, including engineering, physics, economics, and biology, to model and analyze complex systems. With the advent of computers and numerical methods, it is now possible to solve many problems that were previously too difficult to solve by hand, and to simulate complex systems with great accuracy.

21st century: Calculus remains a foundational field of mathematics, with ongoing research focused on further refining the theory and its applications. Modern research in calculus includes the study of partial differential equations, which are used to model phenomena such as heat flow and fluid dynamics, and the development of new numerical methods for solving these equations. Calculus is also used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, where it plays a critical role in optimization algorithms and the training of neural networks. As our understanding of the natural world and the universe continues to grow, calculus will remain a vital tool for modeling and understanding the behavior of complex systems.
