    <h1>Concept of Limits</h1>
    <p>The formal definition of a limit is a mathematical concept used to describe the behavior of a function as it approaches a specific value. In calculus, the limit of a function is denoted by the symbol lim and is expressed as the value that the function approaches as the input variable approaches a certain value. The formal definition of a limit states that if a function f(x) approaches a limit L as x approaches a value a, then for every positive number ε, there exists a positive number δ such that if 0 < |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - L| < ε. In simpler terms, this means that as the input variable gets closer and closer to the value a, the function f(x) gets closer and closer to the limit L.</p>
    <p>Examples of limits include:
    <ul>
      <li>The limit of f(x) = 1/x as x approaches infinity is zero.
      <li>The limit of f(x) = sin(x)/x as x approaches zero is one.
      <li>The limit of f(x) = 1/x as x approaches zero does not exist.
      <li>The objectives of this lesson are for students to:
    </ul>
