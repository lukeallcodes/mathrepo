    <h1>Concept of Limits</h1>
    <p>The formal definition of a limit is a mathematical concept used to describe the behavior of a function as it approaches a specific value. In calculus, the limit of a function is denoted by the symbol lim and is expressed as the value that the function approaches as the input variable approaches a certain value. The formal definition of a limit states that if a function f(x) approaches a limit L as x approaches a value a, then for every positive number ε, there exists a positive number δ such that if 0 &lt; |x - a| &lt; δ, then |f(x) - L| &lt; ε. In simpler terms, this means that as the input variable gets closer and closer to the value a, the function f(x) gets closer and closer to the limit L.</p>
    <p>Examples of limits include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The limit of f(x) = 1/x as x approaches infinity is zero.</li>
      <li>The limit of f(x) = sin(x)/x as x approaches zero is one.</li>
      <li>The limit of f(x) = 1/x as x approaches zero does not exist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The objectives of this lesson are for students to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the formal definition of a limit.</li>
      <li>Compute limits using algebraic and graphical methods.</li>
      <li>Identify and interpret the behavior of functions as they approach a limit.</li>
      <li>Apply the concept of limits to solve real-world problems.</li>
    </ul>
    
     <p>The formal definition of a limit can be expressed using mathematical notation and vocabulary as follows:</p>

     <p>Let f(x) be a function defined on an interval containing a, except possibly at a itself. We say that the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is L, denoted by</p>

     <p>lim x→a f(x) = L,</p>

     <p>if for every ε &gt; 0, there exists a δ &gt; 0 such that if 0 &lt; |x - a| &lt; δ, then |f(x) - L| &lt; ε.</p>

     <p>In this definition, ε and δ are positive numbers that represent the size of the error allowed between the function value and the limit. If we can find a small enough δ for any ε, then we say the limit exists and is equal to L. This definition captures the idea that the function approaches the limit as we get closer and closer to the point a, but it may not necessarily be defined at a.</p>

     <p>To illustrate the concept of a limit graphically, consider the function f(x) = (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1). If we plot this function, we see that it is undefined at x = 1 because of the division by zero. However, as x approaches 1 from both sides, the function values get closer and closer to 2. This behavior is indicated by the two dashed lines in the graph below, which represent the limits from the left and right sides of 1, respectively.</p>

     <p>Here are five basic algebraic limit problems:</p>

     <ol>
       
       <li>lim x→2 (x^2 - 4)/(x - 2)</li>
       <li>lim x→-3 (x^3 + 27)/(x + 3)</li>
       <li>lim x→0 (sin x)/x</li>
       <li>lim x→∞ (5x - 3)/(2x + 1)</li>
       <li>lim x→1 (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1)</li>
       
     </ol>
